excerpt: 'This paper is an attempt to apply neural networks to classify pneumonia images. The classifying model is built based on thousands of the actual X-ray images, which relatively belong to both pneumonia patients and normal people. The classification neural network, a popular way of machine learning, will serve as a supplementary means to help diagnose pneumonia and perform pre-screening. The paper analyzes and contains details of the algorithms we used. By analyzing the structure of the network, we come up with several useful methods to improve the model, so as to achieve a better model structure and application to classification. The new structure we propose is demonstrated in this paper. The final training accuracy is over 95% and the test accuracy is approximately 92%'
